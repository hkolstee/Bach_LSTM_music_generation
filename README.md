# Bach unfinished fugue
## This project one of the project suggestions for a course at my university, the description is as follows:

Long time ago (1993) there was a time series prediction competition organized by the Santa Fe
Institute which became rather famous in the community. The 6 data sets used for that competition have entered
the folklore of the time series prediction community. Among the data sets, the last – and by far most difficult one
– is an unfinished fugue written by Bach. The task was to use machine learning to complete the composition of
this fugue. Achieving that would amount to finishing a genius' work… In retrospect, one can marvel at the
audacity and innocence of the competition organizers; this task is of an unfathomable difficulty and far from
being solved even today. But it is fun to try one's best and see what piece of artificial music art one can get with
the machine learning tools that one masters.
